Nitrox Analyzer
===============

A completely overkill Atmel (AT90USB1287) based nitrox/oxygen analyzer.

Uses a Vandagraph R-17 oxygen micro fuel cell.

Implemented features:

- Hold current value (push button)
- Easy air calibration (hold button for 1.5 sec)
- Push button to power on, auto power off after 5 minutes idle.
- Nokia 5110 LCD with big oxygen percentage readout + bar graph

Planned features / Half baked ideas:

- Helium/Trimix analyzer using ultrasound
- Logging of analyzed values w/ date (+ export via USB).
- Logging of air calibration values (predict fuel cell failure)
- USB Bootloader (for easy firmware upgrades)
- Menu system and rotary encoder for navigation.

Made by Stian Eikeland and Bernt Hustad Hembre.
